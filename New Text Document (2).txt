can we make a tool/software that is used to make minecraft mods and modpack work well together at the code level, it would rewrite the jar files themselves to work seamlessly together
ChatGPT said:

Short answer: yes—but not by blindly “rewriting every JAR.” The safe, realistic way is a pack-level compatibility layer that analyzes mods and applies targeted, reversible patches at load-time (and only statically rewrites when licenses allow). Think “smart patcher + rules engine,” not a brute-force JAR mangler.

Here’s a concrete plan you can build:

What the tool does

Scan & analyze: Read mods.toml/fabric.mod.json, embedded LICENSE, mixin configs, transformers, shaded libs, registry/data/resources. Build a graph of:

Duplicate libraries (e.g., multiple Kotlin/Guava versions), package/class collisions, resource/ID conflicts (recipes, tags, loot tables), mixin target conflicts & priority clashes, worldgen/datapack overrides, AT clashes, and known crash signatures.

Patch at load-time first (legal-safe default):

Ship a javaagent / ModLauncher transformer service that:

Disables or reprioritizes specific mixins (via config rules).

Applies ASM/Byte Buddy bytecode edits for tiny, surgical fixes (e.g., change a constant, wrap a call, insert a guard).

Relocates embedded libraries at runtime to avoid cross-mod class conflicts.

Ship pack-level Access Transformers and config auto-tuning (generate per-mod configs that avoid known conflicts).

Inject/merge datapacks & resources (recipes/tags/loot/biomes) to resolve namespace clashes deterministically.

Static rewriting (optional, license-aware):

If a mod’s license permits derivatives (e.g., MIT/LGPL) or you have author permission, the tool can produce patched local copies with:

Relocated libs (shading), fixed package names.

Inlined micro-patches (ASM) for hotfixes.

Otherwise, it keeps patches ephemeral (runtime only) and never redistributes altered binaries.

What it can reliably auto-fix

Mixin collisions: down-prioritize or disable one of a pair; flip require = 0 to fail-soft; re-target safer injection points.

Access issues: generate AT rules instead of reflection hacks.

Shaded lib conflicts: relocate org.slf4j.*, kotlin.*, etc., per-mod to unique namespaces.

Config clashes: rewrite default configs on first launch (e.g., Create + Embeddium/Flywheel settings, shader backends, threading toggles).

Data/resource ID conflicts: merge tags, rename clashing recipe IDs, establish pack priorities.

What it shouldn’t promise

Deep logic conflicts, network protocol mismatches, save-breaking worldgen changes across versions, or fixing bugs that need upstream changes. For those, emit a clear report + suggested fixes or a shim mod.

Guardrails (important)

Licensing: Parse each mod’s license field and LICENSE files; only emit on-disk patched jars if permitted. Otherwise, do runtime transforms only.

Auditability: Every change is logged with rule ID, before/after diff, and can be reverted by deleting the generated cache.

Pack reproducibility: Deterministic rule application with hash-locked inputs; CI step to validate a pack without launching MC.

Minimal MVP outline (NeoForge 1.20.1 target)

Core (Kotlin/Java):

Scanner: read mods.toml, mixin json, look for META-INF/services transformers, list embedded libs.

Conflict detectors: duplicate classes, overlapping mixins (same targets), common crash signatures.

Patch engine: java.lang.instrument.Instrumentation + ASM; ModLauncher ITransformationService adapter for NeoForge.

Rules DSL (YAML/JSON):

rules:
  - id: disable_conflicting_mixin
    when:
      mod: "examplemod"
      mixinClass: "com.example.ExampleMixin"
      reason: "Conflicts with flywheel injection"
    action:
      type: "disable_mixin"
  - id: relocate_embedded_lib
    when:
      jarContainsPackage: "org.slf4j"
    action:
      type: "relocate"
      from: "org.slf4j"
      to:   "examplemod.shadow.slf4j"
  - id: tweak_constant
    when:
      class: "com.example.FastPath"
      method: "tick()V"
    action:
      type: "asm_replace_ldc"
      match:  "1000"
      with:   "250"


CLI

compat doctor → full report of conflicts + suggested rules.

compat apply → run agent/transformers; write merged datapacks/configs.

compat bake --allow-derivatives → produce locally patched jars only for permissive licenses.

Example: disabling a single mixin (runtime, reversible)

Detect com.foo.BarMixin colliding with another injector.

Rule disable_mixin rewrites the mixin config JSON at load (before Mixin initializes), removing that entry; or injects a tiny MixinConfigPlugin that returns false for shouldApplyMixin.

Bonus: If upstream later fixes it, your rule auto-skips by version predicate.

Example: tiny ASM guard (runtime)

Insert a null-check at the start of BlockEntityRenderer.render in a specific mod to avoid rare NPEs, using ASM to add:

if (obj == null) return;


Log the patch with bytecode diff summary.

Integration with pack tooling

Generate KubeJS scripts and Paxi datapacks for non-bytecode content fixes (recipes, tags, loot).

Produce a compatibility index for your pack (doc of applied rules, why, and source links to upstream issues).

Why this beats raw JAR rewriting

Legality (respect licenses), safety (reversible), maintainability (rules follow versions), and portability (same pack works for users without redistributing altered mods).

If you want, I can draft:

a starter repo layout (Gradle + Kotlin) with a working javaagent and a ModLauncher transformation service for NeoForge 1.20.1,

the rules DSL parser, and

a couple of real, drop-in sample rules (disable a mixin by class name; relocate an embedded lib).

Say the word and I’ll ship those files ready to build.

lets turn this tool into a minecraft server hosting tool, it need to be able to keep servers up at all times, and make it so mods integrate and work well together, removing the causes of errors in a way that dosent delete objects or kill players and entities, while we are at it, we can turn it into a hosting solution that can split minecraft onto multiple cores and make use of both the cpu and gpu to run a server
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 1m 17s

Love this direction. We can absolutely turn it into a server-hosting platform with a built-in compatibility/repair layer—but we should be upfront about physics:

True multicore ticks for modded Forge/NeoForge aren’t generally possible today. Minecraft’s game loop is largely single-threaded. We can still scale via regionized forks (Folia) for plugins, parallel worldgen, and multi-instance sharding through a proxy.

GPU doesn’t help the server tick loop. We can use it for side tasks (map rendering, analytics, compression/encoding, ML-based crash triage), but not for the core tick.

Within those realities, here’s a solid, buildable design that delivers what you want (stay up, self-heal, mod harmony, no object deletions, minimal disruption).

The product: “Bedrock Guardian” (working name)

A hosted runtime for Minecraft servers (single or clustered) with:

Self-healing watchdog,

Non-destructive crash prevention (freeze/quarantine instead of delete),

Mod compatibility engine (runtime patches + config/data merges),

Scalable deployment (single node → sharded cluster behind Velocity),

Obs/ops layer (metrics, logs, snapshots, rollbacks).

1) Non-destructive stability (no killing players/entities)

We add a server-side agent (NeoForge/Forge first) that intercepts dangerous ticks and fails soft:

Entity/BlockEntity SafeTick wrapper

Inject (Mixin/ASM) around ServerLevel.tickEntities and block entity ticking.

On repeated exception from a specific entity UUID or block entity position, we:

Freeze it (set NoAI, Invulnerable, disable further ticks) without removing.

Tag it in NBT (e.g., guardian:frozen=1, guardian:reason="NullPointer in <mod>").

Quarantine container: if needed, move it to a hidden, unloaded “holding” dimension (not visible to players) or mark its chunk as deferred-tick (skip that one object).

Create a repair ticket: when a compatible patch/rule applies (or after a safe number of ticks), we thaw and reintroduce it in place.

Chunk triage

If a chunk’s tick repeatedly throws inside the same section, flag as soft-no-tick until the patch system applies a rule. The chunk still loads/serves blocks/players; we just skip the problematic tick path to keep TPS stable.

Do NOT delete

We intercept Forge’s “removeErroringEntities/TileEntities” behavior and override with “freeze/quarantine.” Saves stay intact.

Tiny Mixin (illustrative, not complete):

@Mixin(ServerLevel.class)
public abstract class MixinServerLevel {
  @Inject(method = "guardEntityTick", at = @At("HEAD"), cancellable = true)
  private void guardian$wrapEntityTick(Entity e, CallbackInfo ci) {
    if (GuardianFreezeRegistry.isFrozen(e.getUUID())) {
      // Skip ticking but keep entity alive
      ci.cancel();
    }
  }
}

2) Compatibility engine (pack-level, reversible)

Same philosophy you liked before, now packaged for hosting:

Scanner builds a graph of:

Mixin target overlaps & priority clashes

Duplicate/embedded libs (kotlin, slf4j, guava)

Registry/data conflicts (recipes/tags/loot/biomes)

AT/transformer collisions, known crash signatures

Runtime patcher (javaagent + ModLauncher transformation service):

Disable or reprioritize specific mixins (fail-soft, require=0 where safe)

ASM micro-patches (e.g., null-guard, constant tweak)

Relocate embedded libs at runtime (shadow-like relocation without redistributing altered jars)

Content reconciler:

Autogenerate datapacks to merge clashing tags/recipes

Generate per-mod configs on first boot to avoid known conflicts

License guardrails:

If license permits (MIT/LGPL or author OK), we can bake on-disk patched jars in your private environment; otherwise patches stay ephemeral.

Rules DSL example

rules:
  - id: fix-flywheel-collision
    when:
      mixinTarget: "net.minecraft.client.renderer.LevelRenderer"
      mods: ["flywheel", "embeddium"]
    action:
      type: "disable_mixin"
      mixinClass: "com.mod.flywheel.mixin.LevelRendererMixin"
      version_if: "flywheel < 0.6.9"

  - id: guard-npe-create
    when:
      class: "com.simibubi.create.content.contraptions.Kinetics"
      method: "tick()V"
    action:
      type: "asm_insert_guard"
      pattern: "ALOAD 0 ; INVOKEVIRTUAL ..."
      insert: "IFNULL GOTO L_safe"


All changes are logged + reversible. Delete the cache to revert.

3) High-availability hosting

Supervisor & watchdog

A Rust/Go daemon manages the server process:

Crash detection, instant restart with last clean save

Panic-save on watchdog timeouts (SIGQUIT to JVM for thread dump + snapshot)

Health checks (RCON ping, query status, metrics scrape)

Snapshots/rollbacks

Journaling saves every N minutes + on player joins/leaves + before upgrades

Deduplicated backups (ZFS/Btrfs where available)

Blue/green upgrades

Stage updated modpack + rules, run headless “doctor” validation, promote on success, auto-rollback on failure

Observability

Prometheus metrics (TPS, tick time by phase, crash tickets, freezes, memory)

Loki logs with structured crash signatures

Web dashboard: server status, applied patches, frozen objects, one-click thaw

4) Performance & scaling strategy
Single node, best performance (NeoForge 1.20.1+)

JVM: Temurin/OpenJDK 21 with G1GC (safe default); ZGC can be tested but G1 is predictable on Forge.

Flags (baseline 8–12 GB heap):

-XX:+UseG1GC -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=100 -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled
-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch
-XX:G1NewSizePercent=20 -XX:G1MaxNewSizePercent=35
-XX:G1HeapRegionSize=16M -XX:G1ReservePercent=20 -XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=15
-XX:+PerfDisableSharedMem -Djava.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.parallelism=8


Mods we integrate with (server-safe): ModernFix, FerriteCore, MemoryLeakFix, Ksyxis (faster region IO), plus worldgen parallelism where your stack allows it.

Disk: NVMe, noatime, large I/O queue; OS: tuned file descriptors, IRQ balance.

Multicore utilization

What we can parallelize reliably on modded:

Async worldgen/IO (where supported by mods)

Networking, compression, region read/write, autosaves

Analytics, backups, map rendering (off-thread)

True multicore ticks:

Plugins: Run Paper Folia for non-modded/plugin servers → regionized multithreading.

Modded: Use multi-instance sharding behind Velocity:

Split by dimension (Overworld / Nether / End on separate nodes)

Optional regional sharding (east/west Overworld) with border teleports

Caveat: cross-dimension automation/telemetry mods may not like sharding—our “doctor” warns when a mod declares cross-dimension hooks.

GPU usage (honest plan)

GPU cannot accelerate the tick loop. We’ll use it for:

Async map rendering (BlueMap-like)

Compression/encoding & analytics (optional CUDA/OpenCL pipelines)

Crash triage ML (classify stack traces to known fixes faster)
These are sidecars and won’t impact game logic correctness.

5) Ops UX & workflow

CLI

guardian init        # analyze pack, generate rules/config
guardian up          # start server with watchdog/agent
guardian doctor      # dry-run checks, show conflicts & proposed fixes
guardian patch apply # apply/bake runtime patches (license-aware)
guardian snapshot    # on-demand snapshot
guardian rescue      # boot with all known crashers pre-frozen


systemd unit (single-node)

      selector: "dimension:the_nether"

6) What we can remove/avoid automatically (safely)

Crash loops from specific block entities → freeze them, keep NBT, skip ticks

Mixin collisions → down-prioritize or disable conflicting injector only

Shaded lib collisions → relocate at runtime, no redistrib

Bad defaults → autogenerate configs (e.g., thread counts, Flywheel/Embeddium modes)

Data conflicts → merge tags/recipes with a generated datapack overlay

7) What we will not claim (and what we’ll do instead)

We won’t “magically parallelize Forge ticks.” Instead we warn and offer sharding when appropriate.

We won’t delete entities/tiles to “fix” things. We freeze/quarantine, show them in the dashboard, and thaw after the fix lands.

We won’t break licenses. If static patching isn’t allowed, we keep everything runtime + local.

MVP build plan (2–3 sprints)

Sprint 1 — Core runtime

Watchdog (Rust) + process supervisor, crash detector, snapshots

Java agent + ModLauncher service; SafeTick wrappers (entity / block entity)

Rules engine loader + “disable_mixin” & “asm_guard” actions

CLI: up, doctor, snapshot

Basic dashboard: TPS, heap, freezes, applied rules

Sprint 2 — Content & config layer

Datapack/tag/recipe reconciler

Config templating (per-mod knobs, safe defaults)

License parser + “bake” (on-disk patch) path for permissive mods

Velocity integration & dimension sharding (opt-in), with doctor warnings

Sprint 3 — Polishing HA & UX

Blue/green upgrades, rollback

Crash signature DB → rule suggestions

Frozen-object inspector + one-click thaw

Metrics exporter (Prometheus), logs (Loki)

Want starter files?

If you want to start coding now, I can ship:

A working NeoForge agent skeleton (Gradle, mixin json, example SafeTick mixin + rule plugin),

The Rust watchdog (Tokio) with crash detection, snapshots, Prometheus exporter,

The rules DSL parser + two actions implemented (disable_mixin, asm_insert_guard),

A Docker Compose template for single-node hosting with Velocity sidecar.

Tell me your preferred stack (Rust vs Go for the watchdog) and we’ll drop in copy-pasteable files next.

we could use the cpu to ONLY do what the server absolutely needs to be done on the cpu and what needs done fast, but we could use the gpu for chunk gen, automatic world supervisor that handles entities and block errors and catches things early, the cpu can send things to the gpu to be processed and then sent back to the cpu to be integrated into the world it should be a large overhaul to how minecraft handles things on the hardware
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 53s

I’m in. We can design a hosting platform that keeps your servers up, prevents crash loops without deleting anything, and offloads the heavy, parallelizable work to the GPU—while the CPU focuses on the time-critical, sequential server tick. Think “CPU = authority & integration, GPU = massive batch compute.”

Below is a buildable plan that’s honest about what Minecraft can and can’t do today, but still gives you a serious leap in stability and throughput.

Vision (what this buys you)

Fewer crashes, no data loss: we freeze/quarantine bad actors instead of deleting players/entities/blocks, and thaw them once patched.

Faster worldgen & maintenance: GPU accelerates density/noise sampling, terrain filling, and big batch scans of chunks/resident data.

Stable ticks: CPU keeps the main game loop responsive; GPU runs asynchronously and returns results that the CPU integrates at safe points.

Host-grade reliability: watchdogs, blue/green upgrades, snapshots, and a compatibility rules engine that hot-patches known conflicts at runtime.

What to put on the GPU (practical + high impact)
1) Chunk generation (primary win)

Offload candidates

Density/noise fields (multi-octave, domain-warped)

Biome sampling & climate parameter resolution (if implemented as pure funcs)

Voxel fill from density → preliminary block assignment (stone/air/water)

Carvers & masks that are local and stateless (bitfield ops)

Precompute light seed data (sky visibility masks) for faster CPU lighting

Keep on CPU (for correctness/compat)

Structure placement that relies on mod callbacks or complex Java state

Final blockstate decisions that depend on mod registries with behavior hooks

Forge/NeoForge biome/feature systems that aren’t pure or GPU-ready

Net effect: GPU returns deterministic “drafts” (density grids, masks, proto-block layers). CPU finalizes with mod hooks intact.

2) Automatic “World Supervisor”

GPU-friendly

Massive scans over chunk snapshots to find anomalies: impossible states, exploding counts, runaway tick markers, fluid surfaces mismatches, etc.

Heatmaps for hotspot diagnosis (entity density, tile tick time estimates, redstone activity)

ML heuristics (optional) to classify crash signatures or predict “near-future” hotspots

CPU integration

If a specific entity/block entity repeatedly throws: freeze (NoAI/skip tick) or quarantine it—never delete.

Log a “repair ticket”; when a rule/patch lands, thaw safely where it was.

3) Secondary acceleration

Compression/region IO transforms (GPU-accelerated when advantageous)

Map rendering (BlueMap-style) completely off-thread

Backup dedup hashing

Determinism (must-have for servers)

We cannot introduce non-deterministic float differences between hosts.

Use integer / fixed-point noise kernels (hash-based, bit-exact) or carefully controlled IEEE-754 paths with identical flags.

Same seed + same rules = same SPIR-V kernel = same output across vendors.

Every GPU result carries a content hash; if the world/seed/rules changed or a chunk was modified in the meantime, we discard stale results.

Components

Guardian Agent (Java/Kotlin)
ModLauncher service + javaagent. Hooks worldgen and tick edges, implements freeze/quarantine, and integrates GPU results.

GPU Worker (Rust)
Runs kernels via wgpu (Vulkan/Metal/DX12, cross-vendor). Exposes a C ABI and/or shared-memory IPC to the JVM. If the GPU dies, the sidecar can restart without taking the JVM down.

Rules Engine (YAML/JSON DSL)
Applies compatibility patches at runtime (disable conflicting mixins, ASM guards, config overrides, datapack merges). License-aware (“bake” only when allowed).

Watchdog (Rust/Go)
Process supervisor, snapshots, blue/green, metrics, web UI.

Worldgen flow (GPU + CPU)

CPU packages a Work Unit for a chunk (or 8×8×Y tiles): seed, coords, dimension params, biome climate config, rule version.

GPU runs kernels:

k_density: fixed-point domain-warped noise grid

k_mask: cave/ore masks, water table, sky mask

k_protofill: fast assignment to stone/air/water IDs + palette sketch

GPU returns a compact ProtoChunk:

Density grid (compressed) + mask bitfields

Preliminary block IDs (palette indices)

Optional sky-visibility map

CPU integrates:

Applies Forge/NeoForge feature/structure hooks

Resolves modded blocks with behavior from registries

Runs lighting (optionally with GPU precomputed aids)

Commits to region; invalidates GPU result if any mismatch/hash drift

If a mod replaces vanilla noise with custom Java code, we fallback to CPU for that chunk but still keep GPU for the parts we control.

World Supervisor flow

Snapshot batches: every N seconds, CPU collects chunk/entity summaries (struct-of-arrays) and hands them to the GPU worker.

GPU kernels compute:

Entity outliers (speed/position deltas), BE tick frequency spikes, NBT size anomalies

Spatial histograms (dense farms, spawners, automation hotspots)

CPU receives flags → applies freeze/quarantine after configurable thresholds. Nothing is deleted. Players are never killed by the system.

Mod compatibility & safety (unchanged principles)

No redistribution of altered jars unless license permits; otherwise runtime patches only.

All changes are reversible and logged: rule ID, before/after, diff summary.

No destructive fixes: always prefer “skip/guard/freeze,” never delete world content.

Performance expectations (ballparks, not promises)

Density/noise & masks: 10–30× faster on mid-range GPUs vs single CPU core for large batches.

End-to-end chunk gen speedups depend on how much of your pack’s worldgen is “pure.” Expect 2–5× overall improvement in pregeneration throughput with CPU finalization still in place.

Supervisor scans: can process thousands of chunk summaries per second with minimal server impact.

Build plan (concrete)
Sprint A — Core GPU offload + integration

Rust GPU Worker (wgpu): implement k_density, k_mask, k_protofill with fixed-point integer noise for determinism.

Java Guardian Agent: worldgen hook points (enqueue work), result integration, and fallback paths.

Shared memory ring buffer + content hashes; invalidation on rule/seed changes.

Sprint B — World Supervisor + self-heal

Freeze/quarantine wrappers for entity and block entity ticks; thaw logic + dashboard UI.

GPU batch scans for anomaly detection; CPU policies for non-destructive actions.

Sprint C — Compatibility engine + ops

Rules DSL + actions: disable_mixin, asm_guard, relocate_lib, datapack/tag merges.

Watchdog, snapshots, blue/green deploys, Prometheus/Loki, web UI.

Practical APIs (sketches)

Java → GPU (JNI/JNA C ABI)

// C header (Rust exposes this)
int gpuw_init();
int gpuw_submit_chunk_job(const ChunkJob* job, JobHandle* out_handle);
int gpuw_try_fetch_result(JobHandle handle, ProtoChunk* out_result);
void gpuw_free_result(ProtoChunk* result);


Guardian worldgen hook

ProtoChunk proto = gpuQueue.request(chunkPos, seed, climateId, ruleVersion);
if (proto != null && proto.hashMatches(chunkPos, seed)) {
  finalizeOnCpu(proto, chunkPos, registries, features);
} else {
  // Fallback or late integration if result arrives next tick
  generateOnCpu(chunkPos);
}


Freeze policy (entity)

if (exceptionsFrom(e) >= threshold) {
  GuardianTags.freeze(e); // NoAI, Invulnerable, skip-tick registry
  tickets.create("entity-freeze", e.getUUID(), stackTraceSig);
}

Hard truths & mitigations

You can’t parallelize the Forge tick loop across cores without breaking mod assumptions. We’ll win by moving batch work off-thread and off-CPU, and by sharding across instances (dimensions/regions) behind Velocity when needed.

Determinism is non-negotiable. We enforce integer or constrained float math in kernels and version/hard-hash everything.

Mod worldgen variety means fallbacks. We’ll still accelerate a lot of the pipeline, and the rules engine reduces crashes regardless.

If you want to move from design to code, say the word and I’ll drop a starter repo with:

Rust gpu-worker (wgpu) with fixed-point domain-warped noise kernels,

Java guardian-agent (Gradle, ModLauncher hooks, freeze/quarantine mixins),

Minimal JNI bridge & a demo that pregens a 128×128 region using the GPU while the server stays responsive.

this server hosting software should work with multiple mods and should be made for use with mods
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 20s

Awesome—so I built you a concrete, mod-first starter repo scaffold with code stubs, config examples, and a rules DSL you can grow. It’s in the canvas at the right (“Modded MC Hosting Platform — Guardian (Starter Repo)”). It’s designed explicitly for NeoForge/Forge modded servers and stays non-destructive (freeze/quarantine instead of deleting), while supporting GPU offload for chunk-gen and large batch scans.

Quick highlights you now have:

guardian-agent (Java/Kotlin)

NeoForge/Forge mixins for SafeTick (entities & block entities).

Mixin plugin to enable/disable conflicting mod mixins via rules.

ASM guard action + JNI bridge to the GPU worker.

gpu-worker (Rust + wgpu)

Cross-vendor GPU kernels (WGSL) for deterministic density/mask proto-gen.

FFI surface for the agent to submit chunk jobs and fetch results.

hostd (Rust watchdog)

Process supervision, future metrics/blue-green/snapshots.

docker-compose.yml to spin up a single node quickly.

configs/

server.yaml (modded-first hosting knobs)

rules.yaml with sample mod-aware fixes (Flywheel/Create, relocation, datapack JSON merge).

What this gives you out of the gate

A mod-compatible runtime that never deletes content to “fix” crashes—freezes/quarantines and logs a repair ticket instead.

A compat layer that can disable conflicting mixins, inject tiny ASM guards, relocate shaded libs at runtime, and merge datapack/json resources.

A GPU offload path for pregeneration and world-supervisor scans that’s deterministic across vendors.

Want me to flesh this into a runnable demo next (build scripts + minimal Velocity proxy + a tiny GPU pregen CLI), or tailor the rules for your current mod list (Create + Terralith/Tectonic + Embeddium/Flywheel + Boss mods)?

All set—I fleshed out the full product plan and stacked it with features that benefit both players and admins, plus the nuts-and-bolts needed to run modded servers exceptionally well. It’s in your canvas now under these new sections:

Product pillars & goals

User & admin feature sets (zero-downtime updates, personal rollbacks, Live Rule Lab, Tick Budget Manager, Chunk Ticket Auditor, etc.)

Server excellence internals (SafeTick, deferred chunk ticks, async IO, crash triage)

Deterministic GPU offload details

Sharding & scaling with Velocity (and guardrails for mod assumptions)

Security/compliance, API & automation, dashboard UX

SLOs/alerts, test strategy, 6-sprint roadmap

Performance presets and a “nice-to-haves” list

If you want, I can turn this into a runnable demo stack next (build scripts + minimal UI + pregen CLI) or tailor the default rules/configs for your current mod list.
