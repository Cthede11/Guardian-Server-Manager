# Nudge policy for stalled actions
If a tool/command produces no useful output, stalls, or exceeds 20s without a heartbeat:
1) Post a short status update to the user (e.g., "‚è≥ Still working...")
2) Try one of:
   - Reduce scope and run a smaller sub-step
   - Propose an alternative approach
   - Ask for one clarifying detail if truly necessary (prefer action)
3) If two attempts fail, summarize what was tried and suggest a concrete next best step.
Always keep nudges brief and action-oriented (one or two sentences).
