- Discovered frontend has many linting issues (unused variables, TypeScript any types)
- Backend still has Rust edition compatibility issues preventing compilation

**FILES:**
- hostd/src/api.rs (fixed modpack download size comment, external API comments, server version)

**NEXT:** Continue roaming cycle - focus on frontend linting fixes and monitor for new issues
